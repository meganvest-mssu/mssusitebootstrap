The professors were incredible and showed that they care by always being there to help students. I always felt welcomed by the faculty and staff. Small class sizes made it possible for professors to get to know students. I had the most wonderful academic advisor who helped me with my four-year plan and helped me succeed in everything I did. I studied abroad twice and it was a life-changing experience each time. Missouri Southern made it easy to get through college! I never had any surprise fees, and the financial offices were always helpful. I got very involved with several clubs on campus, including the Campus Activities Board and Lion Ambassadors, and I had so much fun! I made lifelong friends in both my peers, faculty, and professors. I lived in the dorms on campus throughout my four years at MSSU and I never felt unsafe. I had a very pleasant experience in the dorms from the traditional style to the apartments, and then eventually in the Quads. I love MSSU and the world of opportunities it provided for me."
